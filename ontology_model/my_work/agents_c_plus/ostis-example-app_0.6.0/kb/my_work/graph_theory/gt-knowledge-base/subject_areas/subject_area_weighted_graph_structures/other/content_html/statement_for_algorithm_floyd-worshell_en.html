The Floyd-Worshell algorithm is effective for the calculation of all shortest paths in dense graphs when there is a large number of pairs of edges between pairs of vertices. In the case of sparse graphs, edges of a nonnegative weight are considered to be the best choice using the Dijkstra algorithm for every possible node.

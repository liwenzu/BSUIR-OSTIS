The idea of the algorithm is as follows. Initially, the value of the flow is assigned the value 0: f (u, v) = 0 f (u, v) = 0 for all u, v âˆˆ V. The flow value is then iteratively increased by searching for an increasing path (path from source s to sink t, along which a larger stream can be sent). The process is repeated until you can find a magnifying path.

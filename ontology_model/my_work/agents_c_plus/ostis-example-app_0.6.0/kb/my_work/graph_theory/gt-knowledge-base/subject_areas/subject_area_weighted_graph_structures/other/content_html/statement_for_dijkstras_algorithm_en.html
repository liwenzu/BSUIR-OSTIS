To every vertex in V we associate a label - the minimum known distance from this vertex to a. The algorithm works step by step - at each step it "visits" one vertex and tries to reduce labels. The work of the algorithm is completed when all the vertices are visited.

Initialization. The label of the vertex a itself is assumed equal to 0, the marks of the remaining vertices are infinity. This reflects the fact that the distances from a to other vertices are still unknown. All the vertices of the graph are marked as unvisited.

Step algorithm. If all the vertices are visited, the algorithm terminates. Otherwise, from vertexes not yet visited, the vertex u having the minimum label is selected. We consider all possible routes in which u is the penultimate item. The vertices into which the edges from u lead are called the neighbors of this vertex. For each neighbor, vertex u, except marked as visited, consider a new path length equal to the sum of the values ​​of the current label u and the length of the edge connecting u to this neighbor. If the resulting length is less than the value of the neighbor label, replace the label value with the received length value. After examining all the neighbors, mark the vertex u as visited and repeat the step of the algorithm.

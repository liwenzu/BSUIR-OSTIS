It can be shown that each time the number of edges in the blocking stream increases by at least one, so in the algorithm no more than  n-1 blocking threads, where  n is the number of vertices in Network. The auxiliary network  G_L can be constructed by traversing the width in time  O (E), and the blocking stream at each level of the graph can be found in time  O (VE). Therefore, the running time of the Dinitsa algorithm is O (V) * (O (E) + O (VE)) = O (V 2 E)

The algorithm is used to find the optimal Hamiltonian contour in a graph having N vertices, with each vertex i associated with any other vertex j by a bidirectional arc. Each arc is assigned the weight Ci, j, and the weights of the arcs are strictly positive (Ci, j≥0). The weights of the arcs form a cost matrix. All elements along the diagonal of the matrix are equated to infinity (Cj, j = ∞).

<p>Algorithm is based on two ideas:<br>
<ol>
<li>Subtracting the same number y from all elements of some row or column results in the common sum reducing by y and the optimal solution not changing</li>
<li>If there is a null-cost solution, itâ€™s optimal.</li>
</ol>
Algorithm finds values that should be sourced from all elements of each row and each column (different for different rows and columns) such that all <i><sc_element sys_idtf  = "nrel_weight_matrix">matrix</sc_element></i> elements stay non-negative but null-solution will appear.</p>

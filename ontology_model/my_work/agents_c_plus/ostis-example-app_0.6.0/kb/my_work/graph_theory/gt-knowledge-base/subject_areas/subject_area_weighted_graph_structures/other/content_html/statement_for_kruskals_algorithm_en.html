At the beginning, the current set of edges is set to empty. Then, as long as this is possible, the following operation is performed: from all edges, adding of which to the already existing set does not cause a cycle appear in it, an edge of minimum weight is selected and added to the already existing set. When there are no such edges, the algorithm is complete. A subgraph of a given graph containing all its vertices and a found set of edges is its spanning tree of minimal weight.

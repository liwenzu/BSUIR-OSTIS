The input of the algorithm is given to the <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_connected_graph"> connected </sc_element> <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_connected_graph"> connected </sc_element> <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_undirected_graph"> undirected graph </sc_element>. For each edge, its <sc_element sys_idtf = "nrel_weight"> weight </sc_element> is specified.
First, an arbitrary <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_node"> vertex </sc_element> is taken and a <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_arg"> edge </sc_element> incident to this vertex and having the smallest <sc_element sys_idtf = "nrel_weight"> weight </sc_element >. The <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_arg"> edge </sc_element> found and the two vertices it connects form the <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_tree"> tree </sc_element>. Then, we consider the edges of the graph, one end of which is a vertex belonging to the tree, and the other is not; From these edges the edge of the least value is chosen. The edge selected at each step is attached to the tree. Thus, when each step of the algorithm is executed, the height of the tree is increased by 1. The tree grows until all the vertices of the original graph have been exhausted.

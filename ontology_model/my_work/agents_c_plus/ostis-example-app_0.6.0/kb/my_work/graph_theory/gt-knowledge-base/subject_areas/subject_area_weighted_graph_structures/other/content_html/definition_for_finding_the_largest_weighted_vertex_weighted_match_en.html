A bipartite graph G is given. For each vertex of the first fraction, its weight is indicated. It is required to find the matching of the greatest weight, i.e. With the greatest sum of weights of saturated vertices.

Below, we describe and prove an algorithm based on the Kuhn algorithm, which will find the optimal solution.

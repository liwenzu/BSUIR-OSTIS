<p>Algorithm work consists of a few iterates each of which is composed of a cascade <i><sc_element sys_idtf  = "rrel_edge">edges</sc_element></i> addition to spanning branching of <i><sc_element sys_idtf  = "concept_graph">graph</sc_element></i> until <i><sc_element sys_idtf  = "concept_branching">branching</sc_element></i> turns into <i><sc_element sys_idtf  = "concept_tree">tree</sc_element></i> i.e. <i><sc_element sys_idtf  = "concept_branching">branching</sc_element></i> which consists of one <i><sc_element sys_idtf  = "nrel_connected_component">connected component</sc_element></i>.</p>

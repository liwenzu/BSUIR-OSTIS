<font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">The search process on the
<i><sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_graph">graph</sc_element></i> becomes instructive when to present it in terms of the
equivalent problem, which has a long and interesting history - the
problem find a way out of the maze, which consists of the
intersections, connected by corridors. This section provides a
detailed analysis of the basic research method of each corridor in a
given maze. For some labyrinths specific task can be solved with
simple rules, but for the greater part of the labyrinth requires more
complex strategy. Use of terms maze (maze) instead of <i><sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_graph">graph</sc_element></i>, a
corridor (passage), instead of the edge and the intersection
(intersection) instead of the vertex is nothing else than a semantic
difference, but at this stage of the transition to a different
terminology will feel deeper problem. </font>

intersection mounted lamps that are turned off in the initial state,
and the doors at both ends of each corridor, which in the initial
state are closed. Further, we believe that the doors are built in
windows and lights are powerful enough and corridors quite straight,
so we opened the door, we can determine whether or not the
intersection osveshen at the other end of the corridor (even if the
door at the other end of the corridor is closed). </font>

open at the current intersection, check to see whether you are in a

crossroads for the first time, unwinding the thread as you go and
look for another closed door is already there (ie, return to step

<font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><b>Proof.</b> To prove this
assertion by induction, we first note that it is done in the trivial
case, ie, for the labyrinth, which contains one intersection and no
corridor - we just turn on the light. For any of the labyrinth, which
contains more than one intersection, we believe that this property
holds for all labyrinths with fewer intersections. It suffices to
show that we have visited all the corners, as we open the doors at
each visit crossroads. Now look at the first corridor, which we
choose at the first intersection, and divide all crossings into two
subsets: (i) those that we can achieve by this corridor, and without
returning to the starting point, and (ii) those that we can not
achieved without returning to the starting point. By the induction
hypothesis, we know that visited all corners in (i) (ignoring all the
corridors, which return to the initial intersection, which is
illuminated) and returned to the initial intersection. </font>

<font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Therefore, applying the
induction hypothesis again, we know that visited all corners
(ignoring the corridors leading from the starting point at the
crossroads in (ii), which are illuminated). </font>
